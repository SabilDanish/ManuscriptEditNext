    question: "Manuscriptedit has different packages for publication support. Do these packages guarantee publication?",
    answer:
      "We offer three packages under 'Publication Support' - Premium, Advanced and Standard. Depending on your need either you choose one of them or we can also suggest. Publishing depends on many factors. The quality of research work is the most important criterion. Apart from this, journal's editors and reviewers take decision based on several other factors. For example, if the journal office receives two manuscripts related to the similar field, and if they have some rule that they can publish one article on a particular field per issue, then either they will suggest you to look for another journal or they will delay the publication. Therefore, we cannot guarantee publication if you avail our packages. However, the expert team at Manuscriptedit will assist you to shape up your manuscript in such a way which maximizes the chance of publication.",

    question: "Can you reformat my manuscript that complies with the journal requirement?",

    question: "Do you correct or format artwork under any of the Publication support packages?",

  },
  {
    question: "How does the 'Journal Selection' work at Manuscriptedit?",
    answer:

They are aware of different journals in a particular field, and their criteria of publishing, for example scope, target audience, impact factor, rejection rate, etc. They prepare a detailed journal selection report based on several factors and shortlist 5-6 journals which are best suited for your manuscript.",

    question: "Can I send my manuscripts to all the recommended journals simultaneously?",
